# 2D-Space-Shooter

# ToDoList:

-regeneration is not framerate indipendent
-make the PowerUps feel/look heavier
-Sprites for all the PickUps and the LaserBullets
-the Split Laser is fucked up bc it's child objects are not assinged as split laser childs
-and destruction with lasers has to be managed
-visual indicator for like all Menu interactions
-the shrapnell bullet should be spawned individualy and not as part of the shrapnell explosion
-PickUps just stop when the player dies
-the player needs to have some ivincibility when hit 
-Every WaitForSeconds in IEnumerators are using the scaledTime which they should not...

# Bugs To Fix Later

-if one wave of the wavecontroller is active when starting the game it will deavtivate and activate wrong objects and maybe, probably fuck things up...
-there should be a short cooldown for every enemy shoot to prevent double fireing in one frame
