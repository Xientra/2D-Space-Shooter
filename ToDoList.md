# 2D-Space-Shooter

# ToDoList:

-make the PowerUps feel/look heavier
-the Split Laser is fucked up bc it's child objects are not assinged as split laser childs
-and destruction with lasers has to be managed
-visual indicator for like all Menu interactions
-PickUps just stop when the player dies
-the player needs to have some ivincibility when hit 
-Every WaitForSeconds in IEnumerators are using the scaledTime which they a times should not...
-(at least the standart_lvl_3_weapon turret) while facing left or right the upper barrel is in the focus  
-the Expender Space Ship Small Sprite has a missing part (whoops :3)

# Bugs To Fix Later

-if one wave of the wavecontroller is active when starting the game it will deavtivate and activate wrong objects and maybe, probably fuck things up...
